# X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1

The X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 serves as a supplementary board for motion MEMS and environmental sensors intended for the STM32 Nucleo. It adheres to the Arduino UNO R3 connector layout and revolves around various sensors such as the LSM6DSV16X 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope, the LSM6DSO16IS 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope equipped with ISPU, the LIS2DUXS12 3D accelerometer, the LIS2MDL 3D magnetometer, the SHT40-AD1B humidity and temperature sensor, the LPS22DF pressure and temperature sensor, and the STTS22H temperature sensor. The X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 connects to the STM32 microcontroller or Arduino boards via the IÂ²C pin.
